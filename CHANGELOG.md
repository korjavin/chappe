# Changelog

User-facing Chappe changes are documented here.

This project follows a simple pre-1.0 changelog: user-facing changes, breaking
CLI changes, and security fixes should be listed under `Unreleased` until a
tagged release is cut.

## Unreleased

- Added bot-account auth: `chappe auth login-bot --token <BotFather token>`
  submits `checkAuthenticationBotToken` instead of asking for a phone number.
- Added `--bot-token` to `chappe setup` and `bot_token` / `bot_token_env`
  fields on `TelegramConfig` (env var defaults to `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`).
- Documented bot mode in the README under Authentication.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-19

- Added `chappe compare @ch1 @ch2 [@ch3 ...]` for cross-channel post leaderboards.
  Returns per-channel top posts, a combined leaderboard, and a summary that
  names the mean-forward-rate leader and the raw-metric leader.
- Added `chappe wrapped @channel` which renders a shareable PNG dashboard plus
  a caption template. The card is the Chappe brand: cream paper, forest-green
  and sepia ink, Chappie embedded as a hero illustration. Each channel gets a
  deterministically-chosen mascot pose for variety.
- Added `Pillow>=10` dependency to support PNG rendering.
- Bundled Chappie mascot illustrations (`chappie-recorder`, `signal-operator`,
  `lookout`, `night-watch`, `scout-map-reader`) inside the installed wheel.
- Wired `chappe wrapped` into `bootstrap` `fastest_path_to_value` and the
  `onboard` setup steps once a channel has at least twenty stored posts.
